Description: MBttest method was developed from beta t-test method of
        Baggerly et al(2003). Compared to baySeq (Hard castle and Kelly
        2010), DESeq (Anders and Huber 2010) and exact test (Robinson
        and Smyth 2007, 2008) and the GLM of McCarthy et al(2012),
        MBttest is of high work efficiency,that is, it has high power,
        high conservativeness of FDR estimation and high stability.
        MBttest is suit- able to transcriptomic data, tag data, SAGE
        data (count data) from small samples or a few replicate
        libraries. It can be used to identify genes, mRNA isoforms or
        tags differentially expressed between two conditions.
